test astrology game 

# Game Design
This project is designed to provide a bare astrology service, by separating a natal chart's interpolation from its interpretation.

# Disclaimer 
When prompted, the engine interpolates planetary positions for people born in the US between Jan 1 1950 and Dec 31 2020. This service stops short of creating a traditional astrological natal chart, instead providing only the planetary positions at the given time, without any meaning or inference. 

# TO-DO
Add ephemeris data to extend service prior to 1950 and after 2020 and beyond US-based births; add interpretations or create a GUI to allow developers to add interpretations; CLEAN UP verbose JS with DRY principles; CLEAN UP verbose CSS with LESS/SASS; CLEAN UP verbose HTML; REDESIGN with Mobile First Principles
